# Caelus Rocketry Ground Station

The Caelus Rocketry Ground Station is the software used to monitor and interface with the rocket from the ground. 

This is the second version of the ground software as part of the software overhaul. This version is a more modernized, structural, and complete Django rewrite of the old software. If you are looking for the old software, it can be found at [CaelusRocketry/ground-software](https://github.com/CaelusRocketry/ground-software).

## Setup

Refer to [SETUP.md](/docs/SETUP.md) in the `docs/` folder to setup and run the Ground Station.

## Documentation

All documentation is within the `docs/` folder in Markdown format. This includes but is not limited to the [architecture of the project](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [configuration](/docs/CONFIG.md), and the [packet format](/docs/PACKET.md).

Flight software documentation should be in its corresponding repository, but information on how to run the flight software simulation with this ground station can be found [here](/docs/SIMULATION.md).
